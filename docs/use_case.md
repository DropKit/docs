## Privacy data

If you are a developer of password management tools just like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/). You can use DropKit as the database to take benefits:

- Serverless: no need to deploy a server to store your user's password for sync which is the hot potato.
- Security: DropKit handles all the encryption work. Decentralized data storage gives more confidence to your users.
- Regulation: DropKt naturally complies with GDPR.

## Open data service

You can directly expose an online SQL interface to your customers to meet a wide range of query needs.

- DropKit can limit specific SQL query statements to meet the needs while also balancing data security;
- DropKit can record SQL query records on the blockchain, which is very convenient for customers to check their bills for long-tail customers and billing.
- For customers with high performance requirements, Slave nodes can be deployed at the customer to meet the needs of customers with low latency queries while enabling almost real-time data updates.

## Data manipulation for IoT Devices

DropKit can be deployed globally, and IoT node can write to nearest adaptor nodes directly.

- Lower cost: Without passing all the traffic through a gateway, you can save a large bandwidth cost.
- Faster: The consensus protocol behind DropKit is designed for Internet where network latency is unavoidable.
